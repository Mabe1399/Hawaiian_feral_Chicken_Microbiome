# Relative Abundance Analysis

## Library

```{r, eval = F}

```
## Load the dataset

```{r, eval= F}
load("/Users/matiasbeckerburgos/Master in Bioinformatics /Master Thesis /Hawaiian_feral_Chicken_Microbiome/Backup_workspace/Decomtamination_pipeline.RData")
```

## Set Theme

```{r, eval = F}
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

## Relative Abundance by samples

```{r, eval = F}
# Not normalized
plot_bar(ps)
# Normalized data
plot_bar(ps_Norm)
```

```{r, eval = F}
# Not normalized
plot_bar(ps, fill = "species")
# Normalized data
plot_bar(ps_Norm, fill = "species")
```

## Relative Abundance by island

```{r, eval = F}
# species abundance between island
plot_bar(ps_Norm, x = "island", fill = "species")

# species level between island and samples
plot_bar(ps_Norm, "samples", fill = "species", facet_grid = ~island)
```

## Relative Abundance by sex

```{r, eval = F}
# Abundance between sex
plot_bar(ps_Norm, x = "Sex", fill = "species")

# Abundance between sex and island
plot_bar(ps_Norm, "Sex", fill = "species", facet_grid = ~island)
```

## Relative Abundance by community

```{r}
# Look how to do it but maybe nice idea


```
